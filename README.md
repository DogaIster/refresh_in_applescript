# Reload a page

From time to time we all need to reload a page more than once in a "while".
I wrote this script to reload a page in every 10 minutes. 

This is a bash script with .applescript extension that contains applescript code in it.
Enter the required part on line 4 (e.g. "google.ca").
On Mac I run it using the command . refresh.applescript
